# # this line is a bit of a hack which allows us to import app without changing anything else
# # i think this makes the path set to the parent dir so that app can be accessed
# sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..")))

# from app import app

# def test_get_books_returns_a_200():
#     # here's where we make the test client
#     client = app.test_client()

#     # here's where we make the request
#     response = client.get("/books")

#     # here's where we assert that the response's status code is 200
#     assert response.status_code == 200
